**Status**
 - `index.html` holds a nice 'uploading' component.
 - `canvas.html` handles tiling nicely
 - No actual tile-serving or pyramid-making yet.

**TODO**
 - Refactor `index.html` into a nice Vue component
 - Create a Vite server? (no, overkill at this point. Also why we don't need to refactor yet)
 - Pyramid-generation --> ChatGPT?
